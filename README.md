# SimpleLoginAndRegisterForms
In this assignment, I created the register.jsp, login.jsp, and home.jsp page to handle requests from these pages.
Also I have created connecting links between pages
Created a form with required fields for the login and registration pages.
Handle the form submission with a servlet by simply displaying the information at that point in time.
